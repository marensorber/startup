### CS 260 Notes
## 9.16.2023 github assignment
This assignment was thankfully a review for me, but it was good to practice my vim skills and review the basics of github. I also used git pull --rebase to help with merging conflicts.

## EC2 Assignment
SSH command: The one he gave us did not work for me, so I used 
```
ssh -i cs260/marens260key.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-209-212-79.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```
You exit the ssh command by simply typing exit in the shell

## Route 53
I bought the domain name marensorber.com, and added records.

##HTML Assignments
I completed the assignments on HTML. This was mostly review. I also deployed and inspected the simon HTML, which seems straightforward. Now I need to write the HTML for my startup.
 
## Simon CSS
I inspected and deployed the Simon CSS to my domain at simon.marensorber.com.

## Startup CSS
I accidentally already did some CSS things while I was writing my HTML because I had previous experience and didn't realize I wasn't supposed to add to the style<>. I still have more styling left to perfect, but I'm moving on for now and I'm going to work on the JS.
